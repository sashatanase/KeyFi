User Research Report


# Overview


### Location

The participants of this study are from Uganda, France, Venezuela/Spain, Turkey and Ireland. Since blockchain is borderless we won’t focus on the location and local behaviors and traits.

### Age

Most of the participants were between 30 and 38, there was only one who was younger ( a student ) and who particularly had all of the traits of degens.

### Blockchain Experience 

Most of our participants were either Solidity devs, who were already working in blockchain space or who were trying to start working in the blockchain space, product managers in blockchain space and one student. Most of them were brought in the space by the fact that they were very into the blockchain culture. They were all enjoying their new freedoms and their rights to privacy and anonymity. Not all of them were here for the aim of getting rich overnight, in a way the crypto currency advantages were looked at as a result of the fact that they had adopted the blockchain culture especially Ethereum. One of the participants was very sophisticated and he was organizing meetups on blockchains topics, had a service based on an AI which was sorting crypto news and aggregated them in a newsletter. The same person was a PolkaDot Ambassador and he was planning to become an ETH2 Validator.

There was one exception - the sole degen of the study - who quote on quote wanting “passive income” and who has adopted in 2014 bitcoin and mined because he heard he could get good money. 

All of the five were extremely risk averse and extremely cautious in terms of trusting anything. Three out of five had changed laptops in order to interact with our webapp. Due to the fact that the first participant told me that there was a possibility for his Metamask password to be stolen by me when he was pasting it into his browser extension I have decided to suggest to the participants to stop screen sharing when they were about to log in with their Metamask only to make them feel more comfortable.

### Opinion on DeFi

All of the participants were extremely keen on DeFi. Superlatives were mostly used when asked to describe the DeFi space. Most of them are extremely content that the DeFi space is lowering the barriers for accessing financial products. The fact that is permissionless and  without a middleman as the bank. They like the low fees and their freedom to make the transactions themselves. The sense of control over their funds it’s making them buzzing with excitement. Most of them like the lack of KYC and the anonymity blockchain and DeFi gives them.

They are all conscious of the risks that exist out there but they feel like there is a price they are ready to pay for these advantages.

One of the participants was one of the first people to use Maker and who told me that “ My CDP got liquidated this summer and I was very angry. I was so angry that I didn’t care of all of the DeFi projects that started emerging this year. But then Uniswap sent us their gift so I have received a lot of tokens and somehow my sense of strength was re-established so I started investing here and there again.”

The same participants was telling me that he and his friends are putting money in a vault ( I think it is a Multisig ) and they stake in different places with joined forces - so in a way he is more responsible and more attentive when he is investing somewhere due to the fact that his friends’ funds are in his hands, too. 

I love it because it gave access to, to too many people. It gave us access to finance directly. Like I don't have to ask to my bank. I don't have to pay high fees to access to, I don't know, like finance market. I can do transaction  myself. So of course there are risks because it's your own money and you, you can lose money very quick if you don't know what you're doing, but I love it because it's kind of the way I feel it. It's kind of like we are doing very important stuff and developing new, new, new technologies. And we are not asking banks what they think about it and what are their opinions. We are just doing this. Like, I don't know, creating new wallets. People can get access to money without having a bank accounts. And I don't like the way banks act act in the world actually. So I'm not very, I don't need, I don't, I'm not saying we don't need banks, but I just don't agree with their way of acting. Yeah. And, and this way of doing this without the need, asking their permission to do it, I think it's amazing. 

# Means of getting informed

Most of the Interview Participants are active members of communities living on different media channels. From the study it has resulted that most of them are active on twitter, telegram, whatsapp ( local groups )slack and Discord. Many of them are active on Discord on the projects’ servers where they go purposely to harvest their information. 

Newsletters are also most appreciated and many of them are subscribed to cointelegraph and coin geko. Asked about the newsletter fatigue and how usually people get tired of reading newsletter - they subscribe and then they never open the newsletters - three of the participants assured me that they are opening and reading very consistently their newsletter containing crypto news. 

They are prone to subscribe to weekly newsletters than daily ones. One of the participants has a service done with an AI that sends crypt newsletters  - the AI coms through all of the crypto news and then sends a weekly newsletter  and this is a pro bono feature started from his need for quality news.

Some of them are following crypto influencers- and see them as a beacon of trust and source of truth - but not all of them - mostly on twitter. 

Some of them mentioned that they are listening to podcasts and are subscribed to youtube channels but unfortunately I couldn’t get exact names for these channels which means they either listen to many of them or they are not that important to remember their names. 

Most of the users are staying quite informed and they do a lot of research on their end in terms of product discovery.

### Particular behavior

Three participants have caught my attention - 

one of the participants has described to me how he follows coin geko all the time and whenever a news asset is listed and it’s in the top 50 he goes and checks the protocol’s/platform’s website. He usually goes and reads their whitepaper, checks the whole website, checks their team members and he looks into every each of them doing his due diligence and checking their background, their repos, their entire careers.

A participant from Uganda told me that he has a group of 7 friends with whom he has joined forces and with whom he does research about protocols and platforms - so even though he might not have time the other ones will and they will d the background check for all the protocols that catches their attention.

The third one is the one mentioned above with the AI service for crypto newsletter.


# Decision making process -information needed and trust benchmarks

All of the participants are risk-averse, there none of them who is not extremely cautions - 3 out of 5 changed their laptops when asked to login with their wallet in this study. 

Some of them were victims to hacks and some of them were very afraid of hacks so they are not people who would easily go into using product without a proper background search.

## Trust factors

### Team 

Most of the users have mentioned that they usually want to see the core team of a project at least if not the whole team. They like to go and check their linkedin profiles, github repos and on which other projects they have worked before. I was told that when they see a project with no team presented they do not even consider it.

Some user tells me how he believes that AAVE developers are very good because he met them in person at a meetup and they “ look like good people”. Which is a very irrational thing in a way but still - a good conclusion from this can be drawn - people do not trust anymore anonymous projects.

Tom Forde And know that something is safe. Well, I guess you look, You want to know if, if, if a platform has been audited. So I guess that was my, that was my benchmark, but I've since learned that even that doesn't mean it's safe because of these flash, these flashloan attacks that are possible. So yeah, I guess from my initial phase of just like just trying everything else and not thinking too much about safety when I was putting my money in here, putting the money in there, just, I just want to see how it works and yeah. Kind of being a bit reckless and losing some money that way through  scams, which is basically like the team steals all the money because some of these platinum forums are like anonymous teams as well. You don't know who's buying them so that I kind of started, I guess, trying to lower my risk profile. So I started learning a bit more about, you know, trying to read contracts, trying to learn a bit of solidity so I can look myself, but then kind of definitely looking at looking at the audits and, and just like not trusting an anonymous team anymore. Like, you know, if I'm, if I'm going to put my money somewhere, I want, there are at least to be some faces behind it. And they look into the people who they are, what they're doing. Is there other investors, is there venture capital behind them? What's their background or how experienced are they?

### AMA, meetups and conference presence

Another very important thing regarding trust building is the possibility of the users to talk directly with the core team - either at meetups, conferences or even AMAs. Anything that means a direct connection to the members of the team increases users’ trust.

### Audits

Another aspect that confers trust and a sense of comfort for users to entrust their funds into a protocol are audits. User are looking for the contract to be audited and they search for it to be published and be able to read the audit report. This is something that was mentioned by all of the participants and even the ones who cannot look into the code of a smart contract are interested in reading the audit report. 

The audits are seen as a badge of trust from a protocol.

### Hacks

All participants are afraid of hacks some of them even had fallen victims to hacks, One of them did not want to disclose the details of the hack but the other which shows the traits of degens has told me that when he found out about DeFi he was very careless and he was investing and interacting with everything until he lost a bog amount of money. 

The hack to which he refers is not quite a hack but he has fallen victim to Origin Protocol - he bought stable coins from them called OUSD but one member of the Origin Protocol team has left with all of the users funds. 

For most of them is very important if a protocol or dex has been hacked. As soon as they hear about the hack they loose their sense of trust in that protocol and stop using or even considering them. 

One peculiar behavior is for the degen who told me that he is using right now a platform which was hacked before he started to use it but since they have given their users back some amount of money back he consider that they are interested in existing in the long term so he constantly uses them - even right now he has some assets invested there. The protocol mentioned is called - Value DeFi

This is an interesting behavior and I consider is linked to the personality traits of this user - who is all about the passive income and fast gaining - all of the other participants were very unforgivable in terms of hacked protocols and they were not so much driven by the sense of enrichment but by the culture and tech.

### Whitepaper

All of the participants are checking the Whitepaper document when they are considering to interact with a protocol or they are just curious about it, Many of them are reading this in order to understand how the product works, what is it aiming for and if the project is trustworthy. 

### Cross promo

Something that shown up in this study was that most of the users trust a protocol if some other protocol or someone important in the crypto space refers it. For them these things are the source of truth so they might start quite biased their research.  

### Gut feeling

This is another irrational thing that I kept on hearing from the users - even from one who doesn’t want to interact with different protocols from a defi aggregator, he goes directly to the protocols website in order to place his assets - but when he talks about something that he feels it’s safe he says it’s just a gut feeling. 

Analyzing all of the things the users have told about this gut feeling - this is something more like Kahneman’s System 1 - which seems like a gut feeling but it’s a actually a decision made on top of their former experience. A lot of things are playing an important role in this gut feeling decision - the UI ( if everything looks nitty gritty and aligned and done by pros not by some children playing ), pretty much all of the criteria mentioned above are part of the factors that are giving this sense of trust and safety.


# DeFi User needs for an aggregator

Our study has uncovered that there are three very important things for which users are using DeFi Aggregators:

**A wholesome view of their total portfolio** - many users have stated that they have been using Zapper.fi to see all of their assets. Sometimes they scatter their funds in many projects and they use aggregators to shed some light to this. They also claim to be very interested in portfolio visualization - bar charts, graphs or any kind of viz that gives us an image of their asset percentage and their token volume ( portfolio breakdown ) and to visualize all of their open positions.

**Interest, price and returns** - All of the users interviewed were very risk averse and did not have the courage to make huge moves but all of them were doing steadily  small moves and they were looking for a safe and easy win this is why all of them were interested in Interest Rates and Returns - these are the exact words they have used and it is recommended that we use the same lingo as they do. Which means if they spot very quickly this information that they need they will return to use the aggregator again since it gives them a solution to their needs. 

**Gas Cost** - A very important aspect for the uses is the Gas Price and the explanation around it - even some of them know that an aggregator might do a sum of actions within a transaction and that will influence the gas cost, if this is not explained upfront, some of them who do not understand the perks of the situation will think that this is happening due to some scammy business. They are all expecting to have some gas optimization done by the service.

> I can’t see gas fees. Maybe that will be helpful. Or, you know, when the networks get really busy, you can kind of trick the system with advanced. You can, you know, manipulate the gas amount that you're going to use to run your transaction. So maybe that, that will be helpful if I can see them.

User 4

> I think so when I mentioned that I hadn't used this type of functionality where they kind of, where they consolidate say two or three or four transactions into one check or they try and do that. I think I tried it at once. I can't remember what it was for, but I just remember seeing like a huge Gas price and I was like, okay, I'm not doing that, It had a huge gas fee. Yeah. So then I decided, okay, I'm not doing that. And then when I learned a bit more about it, I understood that like, okay, that's because there is like the equivalent of four transactions here and this one transaction, but, and I might have a, it might've even been, worked out cheaper than, you know, going off and doing those transactions individually. In fact, I'm, I think that's the idea, that's the whole point, but it's still stops. It still stopped me from doing that. And I'd still rather, you know, take each one of those transactions individually, just so like you have transparency, I know more of what is happening with these transaction and how much I'm paying for it.

## DeFi Aggregator needs

Most of the users have used Zapper.fi as a DeFi aggregator and their use cases are diverse and interesting. 

A particular case was the one of the degen who had been using Zapper as a means of education which leads us to a very interesting insight - many DeFi beginners might be using aggregators to learn more about DeFi since an aggregator should be an overview of the DeFi space. 

**Users’ Mental Model on DeFi Aggregators** - since DeFi platforms and DeFi space is a very complex and intricate domain and most of the user want easy wins their expectations of this type of service is to take the cognitive load off their shoulders and do the heavy lifting of the financial strategies.

Most of them read on their own what the DeFi platforms are doing ( whitepapers, forums, podcasts ) but do not necessarily posses the abilities and know how to do investments, this is why they are interested in a service that could do that for them. They seem to be more interested in a very user friendly, human readable non-abstract way of how the service would do that work for them instead of the whole technical details ( at least the texts which explain the capabilities and the features  of the product ).

They expect from a DeFi Aggregator Service to give them an **overview of all of the DeFi Platforms** - especially **aggregated interest rates** - and to make it easier for them to move a position from a platform to the other without going through the whole hassle of accessing each platform, connecting to each of them close the position, open it in a different platform and so on.

Some of the users are very disciplined in their actions so they keep records themselves and build their own ways of interacting with the DeFi space so a service that would do all the things from above would really hit the spot. The catch here is that the service should be easy enough to use and better and cleverer than what they already have otherwise they do not seem to see the advantage of putting the effort into learning a new  product.

> Yeah, both. Both. I would use it because currently I'm using an Excel file to manage my, my cryptos. So it's not very easy to manage. I'd would also look at the fees, because if it's, if it's not interesting for me, I would stay with my Excel sheet and on, I am doing my transaction by myself, but I would try, I think, with a little amount, see the advising AI and see how I, if it works well, I will compare it with another one. I totally forget the name, but I think I have it. Let me look at the name. It's okay. She seems okay. Yeah. I hope I have it in my mind. Something like, I think it's because I'm sharing, I counter access portfolio. 

User 2

## Zapper

Most of the users have used Zapper. For some of them it was a gateway to DeFi, for others is a means to find forgotten assets and an overview of their invested funds, but none of them are really using Zapper for investments. This information is of course only representative for the people we have talked to.

Some of them prefer to use directly the defi platforms because they do not trust third party services, others because they want to experience them directly.

All of them would use the aggregator if it would do something that they cannot do directly in the DeFi platforms/protocols. ( e.g. **move positions from one protocol to an other, AI services, strategic services, farming services** - and Zapper does not provide anything like that from what they’ve told me}

# KeyFi platform testing - feature by feature

In this section of the study I will take the KeyFi product page by page and will list the impressions, thoughts and feedback of the users and I will write some recommendations based on these facts.

## First Impression

Users seem to like the KeyFi naming and they all start very optimistic.

## KeyFi Dashboard

### Total Portfolio/Total Platforms/Total Wallet

Some of the users do not understand the difference between Total Portfolio and Total Wallet. Many of them ask for a Portfolio breakdown which is not present here. They would also expect in Total Platforms to see their open positions not only in AAVE and Compound, and the NET APY not shown for the platforms is stirring a lot of confusion. 

Total Wallet is also a thing of confusion for the users, they do not understand why they are listed so many tokens if they do not even have them in their wallet. This information tends to be irrelevant and distracting for them. 

### Recommendation

**Total Portfolio** - since the study has uncovered that most of the users are utilizing aggregators to find their lost funds and to see all their positions at a glance - Total Portfolio should display a portfolio breakdown.

**Total Platforms** - should be a list of their open positions in different DeFi platforms/Protocols - all of them not only the two selected ones because if a user doesn’t have an open position in AAVE or Compound for her this product will be rendered useless and the bounce will be overwhelming.

The fact that when 

**Total Wallet** - in order to avoid confusion and make this view to answer to the users’ need this should only display the tokens and assets the user has in her wallet not the whole list. 

**Tooltips and Explanatory texts** - there is an utter need of text that explain what the features do and what they stand for. A lot of confusion can be avoided if we add tooltips and informational texts all over the platform.

## Best Rates Table

Users do not understand what the “Best Rates” stand for, they are confused because they do not know what are the **Best Rates** for. Most of them do not know what the term **Supply Rate** stands for. Some of them realize that it stand for the **APY** but it takes a lot of time for them to understand and they wouldn’t spend so much time in a different context outside of the testing to try to understand what  the term stands for. All of the users have played with the chevrons to relist the assets. Sometimes this lifts the confusion sometimes this leads to some more confusion.

>These best rates, best rates. Wow. What is this, this rates about? What Supply rates? About what? I don't know. What is, what is a door? What is this thing 

User 3

> Yeah. I have total portfolio, total platforms, total wallets, [raspberry] is telling me nothing. I mean, in, in portfolio, if we're talking about the KeyFi or the folio, I will expect that that's part, the folio is regarding to the stuff that we have in, in KeyFi, Which I don't know what this means about the total platforms. Why, why do I have that distinction between platform and wallet 

User 4

### Recommendations

Next to the Best Rates title it should be added what the Best Rates are for - also tooltips with explanations and the users’ lingo should be here on the platform as well.  In this case some tool tips for **Supply Rate** could work wonders. Right now the confusion is quite big since there are 2 values for which the Best Rate could stand for - Price or **Supply Rate**. Bear in mind that most of the users are interested in **Price and Interest rates**.

Use the same lingo the users have - as for the case of Supply Rate which was completely confusing it should be used APY which is the one they know.

## Overall Impressions

The page doesn’t come as a solution for the users’ needs of a means of visualizing all of their scattered funds nor to show in an aggregated view all of their open positions from all the platforms. 

The product fails to produce a portfolio breakdown visualization and doesn’t come in handy to see their assets in their wallet since there are a lot of other tokens displayed beside of the ones they own and this creates a lot of noise.

There isn’t enough information fed to the users to understand what are some terms and what do they do. 

Users get quite frustrated when interacting with the Best Rates table.

## KeyFi Platforms

- insert pic

All the users understood how to navigate the two menus - the Asset Menu and the Platform menu. Some of them liked the fact that these categories of actions were there but some of them felt daunted about the multitude o choice and most of them said that they haven’t used derivatives ever. Most of them appreciated the fact that they had different Asset actions on the right menu correlated with DeFi platforms but they were quite frustrated that most of the platforms listed were only listed as “Coming Soon”.

> This is frustrating why do they list it here if they do not work?

User 4

There was some confusion and curiosity stirred by the fact that Compound was always opened default. Also the 0.00% NET APY value was also quite confusing for the users since they were expecting to see the net APY of the platform.  

Some users when trying to do swaps asked if there could be the tokens in their wallets highlighted in the  token dropdown so they can know what they already have.  which leads to a recommendation:

In the context of swapping when the user starts the action and has to choose to swap from his assets to some other one the dropdown could only contain the assets she has in the wallet and when she opens the dropdown for the tokens in which she wants to swap the input amount the dropdown could list all of the options supported.

For the Uniswap platform most of them stated that they wouldn’t use this platform to swap and they would use Uniswap directly since they have a much richer array of tokens and KeyFi has a limited array of tokens.

Some of the users were utterly frustrated that the Platform section did not show them their Compound positions. It is an interesting mental model that should be taken into account - all of the users expected to see a page in which all their positions and different platform could be seen as an overview showing the APY rates and Total Volumes ( which is a very important indicator for the users).

Some of them asked if they could add a custom token. 

**As mentioned earlier - most of the users prefer to interact directly with the DeFi platforms and protocols and this section doesn’t seem for them to bring them any added value. In order for the users to come to the KeyFi platform and interact with the different protocols from within KeyFi there should be something they can do only from KeyFi and not directly from the platform/protocol.**

### Recommendation

Present the users with a page - an overview page with all of their open positions listed, with the different platforms and protocols with their APY rates so they can make an easy comparison in between them. Since users are very interested in best Price rates and best Interest Rates - these information should be dominating the views and should help the users to make decisions for their future investments. As a user has stated he wants to see different APYs so if he sees something better he will close his position from a protocol and open it to an other with better rates. 

Try to make features which are indispensable to them. something which they do not find anywhere.


## KeyFi ReBalancer

- insert pic

This was the most controversial feature of the product. Most of the users were utterly intrigued by the feature and due to the fact that they were not presented with any helping text they imagined a lot and of course since their mental model did not match with the product a lot of frustration has been revealed.

First of all there was very ineffective the fact that there was no explanation of how this feature works, what is it’s aim and what need does it solve. All of the users hoped and thought that this feature will give them the ability to move funds from one platform to the other without getting to the actual platform, same thing with their open positions. They could not understand why the NET APY rates were 0.00% for both of the platforms presented. They couldn’t quite get why there was only Compound and AAVE present and not the others. None of them understood that these are the only two platforms supported. 

The lack of Empty States in the two cards hadn’t helped them either.

Another point of confusion was that the Top Interest Rate was from a platform which was not supported. This fact brought a lot of friction and frustration. 

A top friction point was when users hit the “Manage” button and they were taken to the Platforms Deposit/Withdrawal Page in the DeFi Platforms section. At this point the frustration levels were through the roof. Users did not understand at all that they are taken to that page because they have no funds and they had to deposit funds beforehand. Many of them thought that there is a bug in the platform.

Frustration grew again when they went on the Liquidity section and they were redirected to the same page of the Swap page in Platforms section of the product. At this point one of the most choleric users told me that 

> Totally fuck up. Why, why is doing that?  

User 3

**Conclusion - none of the users understood what the KeyFi Rebalancer does.**

### Recommendations

**EXTREMELY IMPORTANT - to persuade users to use a feature and to make them include it in their routine we need to solve a problem and to do that we have to start by explaining what this feature is about, what it problem it aims to solve and how is going to solve it.**

**List open positions and supported platforms** - In this section users should be able to see all their open positions or at least be told that this feature only supports some platforms and the ones which are supported should be communicated to the users.

**Consistency is needed** - there is a lot of confusion to a user when she clicks on a button situated in a card which has AAVE in the header and then she is redirected to a page that shows her two other platforms non of them being AAVE.

**Less guess work more explanatory text** - Right now as things are the user has to do a lot of guess work and there is a lot of cognitive load on its shoulders and things shouldn’t be like that. 

**Suggestion for Top Interest Rate** - add the timestamp when was the last time the rate was updated so users know how accurate this information is. This is some crucial information based on which they are going to move funds and make investments. We could also give them the possibility to choose the top 5 tokens/assets for which they can see the Interest Rate - not all users may be interested in the token we are showing them. 

We need to help the users and take them by the hand and be their guide. 


## KeyFi AI

- insert pic

In this section of the product users are more content that they are presented with some information about what this feature is about. Most of the users find the second sentence confusing and are still inquiring what this feature is about. They do understand that this is a beta version and it needs to be trained but they are curious if it does, predictions, offer strategies. Many of them are interested in this kind of service but they feel like some information is missing - how is this AI working, what type of service is providing, how do you interact with it. 

All of the users are frustrated because the page of the feature is just informative and there is nowhere mentioned that this is still under construction so they expect to interact with it and they cannot. 

### Recommendation

**F-score** - Since some of the users might know a bit more about the way AIs work to give more trust to this feature the AI F-score should be displayed and open to the public. This would be a benchmark of trust and it should convert users to use it.

F-score details[here](https://deepai.org/machine-learning-glossary-and-terms/f-score).

**Examples of Accounts using this AI** - since we cannot expect users to embark on using this feature only by reading a nice story - let us not forget that we are dealing with very risk averse users and who do not give their trust lightly - we should put together some wallets/accounts which use the AI so we can showcase how this feature works.


## KeyFi Tokens

- insert pic

This section has stirred a lot of frustration and friction. Users were quite unhappy and annoyed with this text. They felt that being directed to the SelfKey Wallet download was some sort of hard sell, schill for the wallet and they got a bit outraged. 

> I would, if I really want to use it, I would register, use their wallet, but almost financing, like just a very few amount just to get Credentials. So I'm not sure if it's the good way to do it, but if they want me to download them on it, I can, I can, I can do it, but I'm not, I, I'm not sure I'm going to use their wallet. 

User 1

Most of them are very much against KYC on blockchain and one of them wanted to stop the interview at this point due to the state of distress he got into. 

On Credentials

> I think it's the controlling. If you want to stake, if you want to participate, you have to use their wallet so you can get Credentials. I don't like to be obliged to do something, you know? So if you do me issue, tell me you can do this, but first you have to download it. It's not, it's not a way of doing that, like to force. So If they suggest me here on the left, download our wallet. Okay. But I don't think it's a good way to, to, to, to, to make people use their wallet by forcing them this way. I feel like I am forced. Like, I am like, it's very commercial way of doing to make money, but this is not exactly what I like to be approached. 

User 1

User are not happy about KYC they are saying that it prevents them from their privacy rights and they feel like it’s against the Ethereum culture and philosophy of DeFi which made it possible for people to own their funds without a middle organization and without any governments implications.

> That's why the government has some strict rules about that. When it comes to KYC, defy has offers their users to keep their identity anonymously with the latest news on the media. What, what we, what I'm thinking of is after some time, since, you know, corporate enterprises are slowly adopting Bitcoin and after sometime the, I think government's gonna push all the exchanges. And in order to when, and then when a user like to make transaction, they should be verified by the government and the exchange. Apart from when you make transaction with an address out of the verified addresses, you can be accused by many things. So that's why defy is still showing some potential to keep yourself anonymous. 
> 
> But this is my point of view because I'm really into this subject. But as an average user, you know, they are doing everything to get rewards for fee. So it won't be hard for them to publish their passport or their driving license or ID on a application since they have been doing it for years, with most of the exchanges that are not have great, you know, background. So, okay. The reward is, you know, it's motivating, but also I would like to ask as a user, what's the idea behind of it? Why should I reveal my ID, you know, to, to use a different platform, which I can use it, you know, anonymously on the other pages or other, other aggregators.

## Overall Conclusions and Recommendations

- insert pic

Asked if they would trust this product all of the users said no. Most of them said that they would need to read the white paper to understand more what the product does, some of them stated that it’s too anonymous and they need to make a background check of the team. I believe the overall confusing flows and lack of information made the users feel uncomfortable and the overall UI mishaps, bugs and slips gave them the impression that they wouldn’t trust their funds inside this product. 

One user has stated 

> It feels unpolished, it looks like somethin that I could do myself, I mean look at those flags at the bottom

User 1

## Overall Recommendations 

-  Add transparency to the project - present the team behind it, make AMAs, give the users the possibility to run a background check.

-  Trust Benchmarks - many users are finding some twitter influencers, podcasts and crypto personalities to be the image of trust. Also the influencers and podcasts seem to be a good gateway for users to find out about different products and services.

-  Whitepaper - access to whitepaper is key due to the User Profile - all of the users are doing research on their end before embarking on using a DeFi product. The whitepaper is one powerful means to gain the users’ trust.

-  A better response to the users’ needs - as our study has shown there is 

    - a real need for a DeFi aggregator to give the users’ a complete overview of their scattered funds, an overview of all of their opened positions, a portfolio breakdown - these three seem to be the top features for which the users are returning to a DeFi aggregator.

    - There is a need of giving the users a complete overview of the Interest Rates and Prices for different platforms/protocols at a glance so they can get help in finding the best APY rates and take their decisions based on this.

    - There is a need to have the possibility to move funds from one platform to the other based on the APY rates without actually going and doing this by hand, platform by platform.

    - There is a need of Investment strategies - something to help them gain easily and lift the cognitive load off their shoulders - a guide for investment

- Retaining and sparking users’ interest - based on the study’s data it was discovered that users’ prefer to do their investment and fund movements directly inside of the DeFi platforms/protocols. In order for them to use a product like a DeFi aggregator they would need to find services and features which do not exist on the DeFi platforms and which are doing and serving different purposes ( moving, opening and closing a DeFi position without going to the platforms one by one). If these desiderates are not met the users will go directly to the original DeFi platforms/protocols.

- Defining better what problem the product solves - having a better understanding of what the product aims to solve will also lead to a better understanding of how the product is solving the need. Afterwards when everything is clear information needs to be communicated to the users in order for them to understand how the product intends to solve their problems. Right now there is a lack of clarity and this affects the way users perceive the product. Mostly they do not understand what the product aims to to for them and how the product would make their lives better.

- Interesting finding towards positioning - the study has revealed that many users utilizing DeFi aggregator as a means of education - they go to these services in order for them to learn about the DeFi space because they have everything under the same roof. Knowing this, KeyFi can assume the role of a DeFi tutor and help the users in their pursuit of learning and starting to invest in a safer manner.
